### SETUP-1 — Bootstrap: standalone extraction + FastAPI Cloud wiring + GE brand creds — CLOSED 2026-08-28
**Owner:** Claude

**Read:** the Mesh Pilot monorepo `src/social_agent` (package `glitch_signal`); FastAPI Cloud getting-started + env docs; vibe-coding-kit THE-METHOD / LANE-LIFECYCLE / DOC-SYSTEM.

**Changed:**
- Extracted `src/social_agent` → this standalone repo (`glitch_signal` package kept to avoid rewriting imports). Proper folders preserved (`src/glitch_signal/…`, `alembic/`, `brand/`, `ops/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`).
- Decoupled the two monorepo imports: `brain.py` soft-imports `meshpilot_platform` (mirror self-disables when absent); `influencer/generate.py` lazy-imports `meshpilot_creative`.
- Added `main.py` (FastAPI Cloud entry → `glitch_signal.server:app`), `.fastapicloudignore`; renamed project to `meshpilot-social-media-agent`; old README preserved as `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- FastAPI Cloud: logged in as the `helpn8nworld` account ("Mesh Pilot" team), linked this dir to app `meshpilot-social-media-agent` (`0d017e5b-1834-4952-8a77-b68f83ff2bfc`, us-east-1). Minted an app-scoped deploy token → local `.env` (gitignored).
- GE brand credentials (`GE_META_APP_ID`, `GE_META_APP_SECRET`, `GE_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN`) pulled from `glitch-trade-app/.env.local` into both the local `.env` and the FastAPI Cloud app env (all `--secret`, `GE_` prefix to match the pre-existing `GE_BUFFER_API_KEY`).

**Verified:** whole package `compileall` clean; runtime-checked the brain guard disables the mirror when `meshpilot_platform` is absent; the deploy token authenticates as `help.n8nworld@gmail.com` and reaches app `0d017e5b…`; cloud `env list` shows all four `GE_` secrets. Commit is SSH-signed; no secrets committed (secret audit passed).

**Remains (opened as lanes):** GE-1 (per-brand `GE_` resolver + Facebook publisher — creds are staged but nothing reads them yet), BUFFER-1 (Buffer is TikTok-only today), DEPLOY-1 (`upload-post` private-fork dep blocks `uv sync`/deploy; external Postgres still needed).
